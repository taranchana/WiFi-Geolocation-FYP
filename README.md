# WiFi-Geolocation-FYP
WiFi Geo Mapping is a Python proof-of-concept that captures Wi-Fi Probe Requests, extracts SSIDs, and visualises them on real maps. Built with tcpdump and modular design, it demonstrates how SSIDs can link to locations while emphasising privacy: all tests use only synthetic or self-produced data.
